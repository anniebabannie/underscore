# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Running locally

```
npm run tauri dev
```

## Generating Types

Structs, Commands and Events defined in the Tauri core code can be exported to TS for use in the front end. We use the crate `tauri-specta` to accomplish this. You can find further documentation on the crate's Github page.
